  <h2>Before Time Moved</h2>
  
  <p>"You can't really know where you are going until you know where you have been." - Maya Angelou 
  
  <p>"The reason time exists is so that everything doesn't happen at once." - Albert Einstein</p>
  
  <p>"There is a thing confusedly formed, born before heaven and earth. Silent and void it stands alone and does not change...that which is naturally so."</p>
  
  <p>"The Way is forever nameless...Only when it is cut there are names."</p>
  
  <p>"It existed before heaven and earth. How quiet it is! How spiritual it is! It stands alone and does not change...All life comes from it." - Lao Tzu</p>
  <p>"I do not know it's name, and so I will call it Tao, the Way [or the Way of nature], and I rejoice in its power." - Lao Tzu </p>
  <p>"It must be something eternally existing! Of all great things, surely Tao is the greatest." - Lao Tzu </p> 

  <p>In the Hot Big Bang Model, at t=0, the universe was in its initial state.</p>
  <p>Less than 10^-10 seconds after the Big Bang, universal temperatures exceeded 1000 Kelvin. And all forces of nature were still unified into one single force.</p>
  <p>Plato and Aristotle believed the universe was eternal and so always existed. So there would be no t=0.</p>
  
  <p>Paradox of Motion. Zeno's Paradox of motion asks, how can something that is motionless, suddenly begin to move? So how can time start, if its initial state is frozen?</p>
